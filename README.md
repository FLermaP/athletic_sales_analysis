# athletic_sales_analysis
This project/excercise is writen in Python, formated and executed in Jupiter Notebooks  
Some of the Pandas features used are:
- Read CSV files
- Pivot Tables
- GroupBy
- Sort Values
- Rename Columns
- Create new DataFrames based on Filters on Existing DataFrames
- Resample and Bin
## Pivot and Groupby
- Both functions are used to return the same values to show how the use of either one is of personal preference
## Resample and Bin
- In this excercise Resample is only used with "Buit In" Day and Week Bins, but there are other options for Binning,
- more information on Binning can be found at: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.cut.html
